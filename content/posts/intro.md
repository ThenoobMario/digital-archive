title: 'Introduction: Maybe a start of something to look back on?'

tags: ['blog']

Hi! It might not be news to some of you that the guy writing this is a nerd. Before I start writing things out of nowhere, I think it is important to tell you that this public display of obnoxious geekiness is but an attempt at two things: to have a digital archive for me to look back on and to make friends as I do it.

If, in the process, I am able to inspire you, dear reader, nothing will boost my ego more (P.S. I need it).

## Topics that make sense

I will try to keep these blogs as a journal that blends my interests and my borderline unhealthy obsessions. Tech, machines, games, and any system humans have poured their hearts into. Literature, history, philosophy, spirituality, and the curiosity of the unknown.

Many have attempted what I am about to. I don't claim to be different. Rather, I take pride in being but a mere branch on a metaphorical neem tree of the human saga.

Dear reader, if you must take something from what I write, then let it be the appreciation of what has happened before, how it shapes the present, and what it holds for the future.

## Frequency?

Man, do I need do? The corporate algorithms would orgasm at the thought of it. But no, I will treat my (very public) journal like a river, varied in size and creating tributaries and canals as it flows [[1]](#ref1).

## On citations, magic spells, and the use of AI

Everything I write will take place in the physical realm. Well, kinda. In the end, the mysteries of the number system were proved in dreams [[2]](#ref2). However, I feel no shame in admitting that I do use AI for aggregating information that might be missed by this lazy ass writer. 

Everything will be cited at the end of the blog (To the best of my knowledge). It may happen that I miss something somewhere. But hey, that's just a part of being human. Point it out and I shall correct it.

## To infinity and beyond! [[3]](#ref3)

To conclude, thank you for reaching the end. I hope you find what I write interesting. And in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night [[4]](#ref4).
